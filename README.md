# About native library loader

The native library loader is a utility that assists with loading native
libraries from Java. It provides the ability to painlessly identify, extract
and load the correct platform-specific native library from a JAR file.

# Usage

### Add dependency

Search Maven Central for [latest version](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a:native-lib-loader)
and add a dependency to your pom.xml.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.scijava</groupId>
    <artifactId>native-lib-loader</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### Package native libraries

Native libraries should be packaged into a single jar file, with the
following directory & file structure:

```
/natives
  /linux-x86_32-32
     libxxx[-vvv].so
  /linux-x86_64-64
     libxxx[-vvv].so
  /osx-x86_32-32
     libxxx[-vvv].dylib
  /osx-x86_64-64
     libxxx[-vvv].dylib
  /osx-aarch_64-64
     libxxx[-vvv].dylib
  /windows_x86_32-32
     xxx[-vvv].dll
  /windows-x86_64-64
     xxx[-vvv].dll
  /windows-itanium_64-64
     xxx[-vvv].dll
  /aix_ppc_32-32
     libxxx[-vvv].so
     libxxx[-vvv].a
  /aix_ppc_64-64
     libxxx[-vvv].so
     libxxx[-vvv].a
```

Here "xxx" is the name of the native library and "-vvv" is an optional version number.
Depending on the platform at runtime, a native library will be unpacked into a temporary file
and will be loaded from there.

The version information will be grabbed from the MANIFEST.mf file
from "Implementation-Version" entry. So it's recommended to follow Java's
[package version information](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/packageman.html)
convention. 

### Load library

If you want to load 'awesome.dll' (on Windows) or 'libawesome.so' (on Linux or AIX),
simply do like this ...

```Java
NativeLoader.loadLibrary("awesome");
```
